This is a software design document practicve with a game development comany. This comapny designed a game simular to pictionary but with the picture being unveiled over time instead of someone drawing the image. The client requestred a singleton programming style for its information seperation and security. The domain model clearly explains the singleton pattern and its general funcationality with a XML class diagram for additional understanding. The design constraints provide the general constraints provided from the client, with experience I will be able to provide most specilitist design constraints from external or unplanned issues. The client had seperation of information for a security feature and a singleton design help facilitate the clients need. This is a common programming style and can be easily implemented. Setting only information needed to designed security heirearchy helps the general player base from information leaks. Then seperating those methods and sensitive information for when a players account is comprimised then there is limited damage someone can do. With an additional encryption of the users information then this has some common secuirty features.
